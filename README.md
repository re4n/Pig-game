# Pig-game
üê∑ - Pig game using JS. For educational purposes.
With the support of Jonas Schmedtmann, creator of the course: The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!.

Demonstration of how the game works:
- The objective of the game is to get 100 points by rolling the dice.
- You can roll the dice as many times as you like, but if the number 1 appears, you lose the points you have accumulated.
- You can hold your points, passing the turn to player 2.
